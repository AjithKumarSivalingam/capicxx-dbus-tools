  "body": "### Welcome to CommonAPI C++ for D-Bus!\r\nCommonAPI C++ is a C++ framework for interprocess and network communication which defines a high-level C++ API that can be used for different IPC mechanisms such as D-Bus.  Please visit [http://genivi.github.io/capicxx-core-tools/](http://genivi.github.io/capicxx-core-tools/) if you are new to CommonAPI C++.\r\n\r\nIn principle the CommonAPI C++ D-Bus binding is based on the standard D-Bus library ([http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/)) but needs some patches of libdbus which are published together with the runtime code of the D-Bus binding.\r\n\r\n### Basic Features\r\n* High-performance serialization of D-Bus messages including introspection. \r\n\r\n### Links\r\n* Code generator (git): [https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-dbus-tools/](https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-dbus-tools/)\r\n* Runtime Code (git): [https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-dbus-runtime](https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-dbus-runtime/)\r\n* Source code as zip/tar, code generator (executable), pdf-doc: [https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-tools-runtime/releases](https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-tools-runtime/releases)\r\n* Eclipse update-site: [http://genivi.github.io/capicxx-dbus-tools/updatesite/](http://genivi.github.io/capicxx-dbus-tools/updatesite)\r\n* Wiki: [https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-dbus-tools/wiki/](https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-dbus-tools/wiki/)\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nPlease mail to the GENIVI ipc mailing list, see [http://lists.genivi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/genivi-ipc/](http://lists.genivi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/genivi-ipc/)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
