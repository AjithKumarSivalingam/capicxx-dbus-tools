== Description

This project is used to create the gluecode for the DBus binding used for running the verification tests from
org.genivi.commonapi.core.verification within CommonAPI-Tools package.

== Build Instructions

Please generate the DBus C++ Code for all .fidl files in src directory. The generated files should be in src-gen afterwards.
Then run:

# autoreconv -i
# configure
# make all

This will build the gluecode in .libs, which you can then use for running the CommonAPI verification tests.
