== Build Instructions for Linux

You can build all code generators by calling maven from the command-line. Open a console and change in the directory org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.releng of your CommonAPI-D-Bus-Tools directory. Then call:
----
mvn -DCOREPATH=<path to your CommonAPI-Tools dir> -Dtarget.id=org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.target clean verify
----
COREPATH is the directory, that contains the target definition folder: org.genivi.commonapi.core.target.


After the successful build you will find the commond-line generators archived in org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.cli.product/target/products/commonapi_dbus_generator.zip and the update-sites in org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.updatesite/target.
